# ðŸŽ“ Project Tooling Sample

This repository contains an example of a JEE project using some industrialized tooling.

The base of the source code actually comes from the [tomee examples](https://github.com/apache/tomee/tree/master/examples/rest-example), and is then completed with lots of industrialized tools to demonstrate how to set them up and use them.

This project is used as a resource for an university training session.
